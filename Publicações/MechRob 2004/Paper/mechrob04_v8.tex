\begin{abstract}
This paper presents an optimal control scheme for a wheeled mobile robot (WMR) with nonholonomic constraints. It is well known that a WMR with nonholonomic constraints can not be feedback stabilized through continuously differentiable, time-invariant control laws. By using model predictive control (MPC), a discontinuous control law is naturally obtained. One of the main advantages of MPC is the ability to handle constraints (due to state or input limitations) in a straightforward way. Quadratic programming (QP) is used to solve a linear MPC by successive linearization of an error model of the WMR. Simulation and experimental results are shown.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

The field of mobile robot control has been the focus of great research effort in the past decades. Besides the apparent simplicity of the kinematic model of a wheeled mobile robot (WMR), the existence of nonholonomic (non-integrable) constraints turns the design of stabilizing control laws for those systems in a considerable challenge. Due to Brockett
conditions~\cite{brockett82}, a continuously differentiable, time-invariant stabilizing feedback control law can not be obtained. To overcome these limitations most works uses discontinuous (non-smooth) and time-variant control laws~\cite{bloch89,samson91,canudas92,yamamoto94,murray97}. Recent works dealing with robust and adaptive control of WMRs can be found in \cite{oya03,dixon04}.

However, in realistic implementations it is difficult to obtain good performance, due to the constraints on inputs or states that naturally arise. None of the previously cited authors have taken those constraints into account. This can be done in a straightforward way by using model predictive control (MPC) schemes. For a WMR this is an important advantage,
since the position of the robot can be restricted to belong to a secure region of operation. By considering input limitations, control actions that stay within actuators saturation limit can be generated.

Model Predictive Control is a control strategy that uses the model of the system to obtain an optimal control sequence by minimizing an objective function. At each sample interval, the model provides a prediction of process states over a prediction horizon. Based on that, an objective function is optimized with respect to the future open-loop control system
inputs. Although prediction and optimization are computed over a future horizon, only the values of the inputs for the current sampling interval are used and the same procedure is repeated at the next sampling time. This mechanism is known as {\it moving} or {\it receding horizon} strategy, in reference to the way in which the time window shifts forward from one time step to the next.

For complex constrained multivariable control problems, MPC has become the accepted standard in the process industries~\cite{bemporad02}. It is used in many cases, where plants being controlled are sufficiently {\em slow} to allow its implementation~\cite{mayne98}. However, for systems with fast and/or nonlinear dynamics, like the WMRs, the implementation of such technique remains fundamentally limited in applicability, due to large amount of {\em on-line} computation required \cite{cannon00}. In this paper we overcome this problem by using a successive-linearization approach, which yields a linear MPC beeing solved through quadratic programming (QP) problem. It is shown that even a real-time implementation is possible. Although MPC is not a new control method, works dealing with MPC of WMRs are recent and sparse~\cite{ollero91,rico99,essen01}.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: in the next section the kinematic model of the WMR is shown. The MPC algorithm is depicted in section~\ref{sec:mpc}. Simulation results in {\sc Matlab} are shown in section~\ref{sec:simulations}, where an eight-like trajectory is used as reference. Section~\ref{sec:exp} presents some real-time implementation details.


\section{Kinematic Model of the WMR}
\label{sec:model}

In this section the kinematic model of the WMR is described. A mobile robot
made up of a rigid body and non deforming wheels is considered (see Fig.~\ref{fig:robot}). It is assumed that the vehicle moves on a plane without slipping, i.e., there is a pure rolling contact between the wheels and the ground, wich gives the following nonholonomic constraint~\cite{barraquand89}:
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:nc}
	-\dot x\sin\theta + \dot y\cos\theta = 0
\end{equation}

The kinematics of the WMR is given by:

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:model}
	\left\{
		\begin{aligned}
			\dot x	  &= v\cos\theta \\
			\dot y	  &= v\sin\theta \\
			\dot \theta &= w
		\end{aligned}
	\right.
\end{equation}

\noindent where ${\bf x}\triangleq[x~~y~~\theta]^T$ describes the configuration (position and orientation) of the center of the active wheels' axle, $C$, with respect to a global inertial frame $\{O,X,Y\}$. ${\bf u}\triangleq[v~~w]^T$ are the manipulated (control) variable, where $v$ and $w$ are the linear and the angular velocities, respectively.

	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.67\linewidth]{Figures/robot.eps}
	\caption{Coordinate system of the WMR.}
	\label{fig:robot}
\end{figure}

By using the Euler method to discretize (\ref{eqn:model}):

\begin{equation*}
	\dot{\bf x} \approx \frac{{\bf x}(k+1)-{\bf x}(k)}{T},
\end{equation*}

\noindent where $T$ is the sampling period and $k$ is the time step, we have the following nonlinear, discrete-time model:

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:discretemodel}
	\left\{
		\begin{aligned}
			x(k+1)	    &= x(k) + v(k)\cos\theta(k)T \\
			y(k+1)	    &= y(k) + v(k)\sin\theta(k)T \\
			\theta(k+1) &= \theta(k) + w(k)T \\
		\end{aligned}
	\right.
\end{equation} 

\subsection{Derivation of a Linear Error Model}

To obtain a linear model, an error model with respect to a reference trajectory $({\bf x}_r,{\bf u}_r)$ is considered. This can be done by expanding (\ref{eqn:discretemodel}) in Taylor series around the reference trajectory. The resulting error model will be used in Section \ref{sec:mpc} for the solution of a linear MPC problem.

The model (\ref{eqn:discretemodel}) has the form ${\bf x}(k+1)=f({\bf x}(k),{\bf u}(k))$. Expanding in Taylor series around the point $({\bf x}_r(k),{\bf u}_r(k))$ and neglecting higher order terms the following expression is obtained:

\begin{multline}
\label{eq:taylor}
	f({\bf x}(k),{\bf u}(k)) \approx f({\bf x}_r(k),{\bf u}_r(k)) + \\ + \left.\frac{\partial f({\bf x}(k),{\bf u}(k))}{\partial{\bf x}(k)}\right|_{\begin{smallmatrix}{\bf x}(k)={\bf x}_r(k) \\ {\bf u}(k)={\bf u}_r(k) \end{smallmatrix}}({\bf x}(k)-{\bf x}_r(k)) + \\ + \left.\frac{\partial f({\bf x}(k),{\bf u}(k))}{\partial{\bf u}(k)}\right|_{\begin{smallmatrix}{\bf x}(k)={\bf x}_r(k) \\ {\bf u}(k)={\bf u}_r(k) \end{smallmatrix}}({\bf u}(k)-{\bf u}_r(k))
\end{multline}

By defining the matrices
\begin{align*}
	{\bf A}(k) &\triangleq \begin{bmatrix}
		1 & 0 & -v_r(k)\sin\theta_r(k)T \\
		0 & 1 &  v_r(k)\cos\theta_r(k)T \\
		0 & 0 & 1
	\end{bmatrix} \\
	{\bf B}(k) &\triangleq \begin{bmatrix}
		\cos\theta_r(k)T & 0 \\
		\sin\theta_r(k)T & 0 \\
		0 			  & T
	\end{bmatrix}
\end{align*}
\noindent and the errors
\begin{align*}
	\tilde{\bf x}(k) &\triangleq {\bf x}(k)-{\bf x}_r(k) \\
	\tilde{\bf u}(k) &\triangleq {\bf u}(k)-{\bf u}_r(k)
\end{align*}
and by considering a reference car described by ${\bf x}_r(k+1)=f({\bf x}_r(k),{\bf u}_r(k))$, it follows from (\ref{eq:taylor}) that
\begin{equation*}\label{eqn:error}
	\tilde{\bf x}(k+1) = {\bf A}(k)\tilde{\bf x}(k)+{\bf B}(k)\tilde{\bf u}(k),
\end{equation*}

Indeed, the convergence of ${\bf x}$ to ${\bf x}_r$ is equivalent to the convergence of $\tilde{\bf x}$ to the set ${\cal O}=\{{\bf x}|(\tilde x,\tilde y,\tilde\theta)=(0,0,2\pi n)\},n\in \{0,\pm1,\pm2,\ldots\}$.

In~\cite{bloch89} it is shown that the nonlinear, nonholonomic system (\ref{eqn:model}) is fully controllable, i.e., it can be steered from any initial state to any final state in finite time by using finite inputs. It is easy to see that when the robot is not moving, the linearization about a stationary operating point is not controllable. However, this linearization becomes controllable as long as the control input ${\bf u}$ is not zero~\cite{samson91}. This implies the tracking of a reference trajectory being possible with linear MPC~\cite{essen01}.


\section{The MPC Algorithm}
\label{sec:mpc}

It was said in section~\ref{sec:intro} that the essence of a MPC scheme is to optimize predictions of process behavior over the control inputs. Such prediction is accomplished by using a process model over a finite time interval, called the {\em prediction horizon}. At each sampling time, the model predictive controller generates an optimal control sequence by solving a optimization problem. The first element of this sequence is applied to the plant. The problem is solved again at the next sampling time using the updated process measurements and a shifted horizon.

For the sake of simplicity, we assume in this work that the states of the plant are always available for measurement and that there are no plant/model mismatch. Also, in order to design the linear controller, it is assumed that the pair $({\bf A}(k),{\bf B}(k))$ is always (at any $k$) stabilizable.

To the problem concerned here, the cost function to be minimized can be stated as a quadratic function of the states and control inputs:
\begin{multline}\label{eqn:cost}
	\Phi(k) = \sum_{j=1}^{N}\tilde{\bf x}^T(k+j|k){\bf Q}\tilde{\bf x}(k+j|k) + \\ + \tilde{\bf u}^T(k+j-1|k){\bf R}\tilde{\bf u}(k+j-1|k),
\end{multline}
\noindent where $N$ is the prediction horizon and ${\bf Q}$, ${\bf R}$ are weighting matrices, with ${\bf Q}\geq 0$ and ${\bf R}>0$. The notation $a(m|n)$ indicates the value of $a$ at the instant $m$ predicted at instant $n$.

Hence, the optimization problem can be stated as to find $\tilde{\bf u}^\star$ such that:
\begin{equation*}
	\tilde{\bf u}^\star = \arg\min_{\tilde{\bf u}}\left\{\Phi(k)\right\}
\end{equation*}
\noindent s. a.
\begin{equation*}
	\tilde{\bf u}_{min} \leq \tilde{\bf u} \leq \tilde{\bf u}_{max}
\end{equation*}

\noindent where $\Phi(k)$ is the {\em cost function}, $\tilde{\bf u}$ is the
free variable in the optimization, and $\tilde{\bf u}_{min}$ and
$\tilde{\bf u}_{max}$ are its inferior and superior limits, respectively.

The problem of minimizing (\ref{eqn:cost}) is solved at each time step $k$, yelding a sequence of minimizers $\{\tilde{\bf u}^\star(k|k),\cdots,\tilde{\bf u}^\star(k+N-1|k)\}$ and the optimal cost $\Phi^\star(k)$. The MPC control law is implicitly given by the first control action of the sequence of minimizers, $\tilde{\bf u}^\star(k|k)$. A block diagram with all components of the system is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:bloco}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=.84\linewidth]{Figures/bloco.eps}
	\caption{Block diagram of the system.}
	\label{fig:bloco}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Derivation of the Quadratic Programming Problem}
\label{sec:qp}

To put the optimization problem in a usual QP formulation, we introduce the stacked vectors
\begin{equation*}
	\bar{\bf x}(k) \triangleq \begin{bmatrix}
		\tilde{\bf x}(k+1|k) \\ \tilde{\bf x}(k+2|k) \\ \vdots \\ \tilde{\bf x}(k+N|k) 
	\end{bmatrix} \quad
	\bar{\bf u}(k) \triangleq \begin{bmatrix}
		\tilde{\bf u}(k|k)  \\ \tilde{\bf u}(k+1|k) \\ \vdots \\ \tilde{\bf u}(k+N-1|k)
	\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}

Thus, equation (\ref{eqn:cost}) can be rewritten as:
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:cost2}
	\Phi(k) = \bar{\bf x}^T(k)\bar{\bf Q}\bar{\bf x}(k) + \bar{\bf u}^T(k)\bar{\bf R}\bar{\bf u}(k),
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation*}
	\bar {\bf Q} \triangleq \begin{bmatrix}
		{\bf Q} & {\bf 0} & \cdots & {\bf 0} \\
		{\bf 0} & {\bf Q} & \cdots & {\bf 0} \\
		\vdots  & \vdots  & \ddots & \vdots  \\
		{\bf 0} & {\bf 0} & \cdots & {\bf Q}
	\end{bmatrix} \quad
	\bar {\bf R} \triangleq \begin{bmatrix}
		{\bf R} & {\bf 0} & \cdots & {\bf 0} \\
		{\bf 0} & {\bf R} & \cdots & {\bf 0} \\
		\vdots  & \vdots  & \ddots & \vdots  \\
		{\bf 0} & {\bf 0} & \cdots & {\bf R}
	\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}

With the above definitions, it is possible to rewrite $\bar{\bf x}(k)$ as:
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:exbar}
	\bar{\bf x}(k) = \bar{\bf A}(k)\tilde{\bf x}(k|k)+{\bf S}(k)\bar{\bf u}(k),
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation*}
	\bar{\bf A}(k) \triangleq \begin{bmatrix}
		{\bf A}(k|k) \\ {\bf A}(k|k){\bf A}(k+1|k) \\ \vdots \\ \alpha(k,0)
	\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}
{\small
\begin{multline*}
		{\bf S}(k) \triangleq \\ \begin{bmatrix}
			{\bf B}(k|k)		       & {\bf 0} 			    	 & \cdots & {\bf 0}         \\
			{\bf A}(k+1|k){\bf B}(k|k) & {\bf B}(k+1|k)      	 & \cdots & {\bf 0}         \\
			\vdots			       & \vdots				 & \ddots & \vdots          \\
			\alpha(k,1){\bf B}(k|k)    & \alpha(k,2){\bf B}(k+1|k) & \cdots & {\bf B}(k+N-1|k)
		\end{bmatrix}
\end{multline*}
}
where the operator $\alpha(k,j)$ is defined as:
\begin{equation*}
	\alpha(k,j) \triangleq \prod_{i=j}^{N-1}{\bf A}(k+i|k),
\end{equation*}

With (\ref{eqn:cost2}) and (\ref{eqn:exbar}) at hands, and after some algebraic manipulations, we can rewrite the cost function (\ref{eqn:cost}) in a standard quadratic form:
\begin{equation}
	\Phi(k) = \frac{1}{2}\bar{\bf u}^T(k){\bf H}(k)\bar{\bf u}(k) + {\bf f}^T(k)\bar{\bf u}(k) + {\bf d}(k)
\end{equation}
with
\begin{align*}
	{\bf H}(k) &\triangleq 2\left({\bf S}^T(k)\bar{\bf Q}{\bf S}(k)+\bar{\bf R}\right) \\
	{\bf f}(k) &\triangleq 2{\bf S}^T(k)\bar{\bf Q}\bar{\bf A}(k)\tilde{\bf x}(k|k) \\
	{\bf d}(k) &\triangleq \tilde{\bf x}^T(k|k)\bar{\bf A}^T(k)\bar{\bf Q}\bar{\bf A}(k)\tilde{\bf x}(k|k)
\end{align*}

The matrix ${\bf H}$ is a {\em Hessian} matrix, and must be positive definite. It describes the quadratic part of the cost function, and the vector ${\bf f}$ describes the linear part. $\bf d$ is independent of $\tilde{\bf u}$ and hence vanishes of the optimization problem.

For the sake of simplicity and to give a major focus on the optimization problem, it is considered that the model describes perfectly the plant beeing controlled. However, there are some inherent features to eletro-mechanical systems that must be taken into account in control problems like the one treated here. In this case, as the wheels are driven by electrical motors, these features are the actuators' saturations, which can be considered in a straightforward way when MPC schemes are used. The optimization problem must then be solved guaranteeing that the control will remain between certain lower and upper bounds. Hence, the following control constraint can be written:

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:uconstr}
	{\bf u}_{min}(k) \leq {\bf u}(k) \leq {\bf u}_{max}(k),
\end{equation}
with the lower and upper bounds 
\begin{equation*}
	{\bf u}_{min}(k) = \begin{bmatrix}
		v_{min}(k) \\ w_{min}(k)
	\end{bmatrix} \quad 
	{\bf u}_{max}(k) = \begin{bmatrix}
		v_{max}(k) \\ w_{max}(k)
	\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}

In this case, as the free variable in the optimization is the vector $\bar{\bf u}(k)$, the constraint (\ref{eqn:uconstr}) must be rewritten with respect to this variable (notice again that $\tilde{\bf u}(k)={\bf u}(k)-{\bf u}_r(k)$):
\begin{equation*}
	{\bf u}_{min}(k) - {\bf u}_r(k) \leq \tilde{\bf u}(k) \leq {\bf u}_{max}(k) - {\bf u}_r(k),
\end{equation*}
or, in the stacked way,
\begin{equation*}
	\bar{\bf u}_{min}(k) - \bar{\bf u}_r(k) \leq \bar{\bf u}(k) \leq \bar{\bf u}_{max}(k) - \bar{\bf u}_r(k)
\end{equation*}
\noindent with
\begin{align*}
	\bar{\bf u}_{min}(k) &\triangleq \begin{bmatrix}
		{\bf u}_{min}(k) \\ {\bf u}_{min}(k+1) \\ \vdots \\ {\bf u}_{min}(k+N-1)
	\end{bmatrix} \\
	\bar{\bf u}_{max}(k) &\triangleq \begin{bmatrix}
		{\bf u}_{max}(k) \\ {\bf u}_{max}(k+1) \\ \vdots \\ {\bf u}_{max}(k+N-1)
	\end{bmatrix} \\
	\bar{\bf u}_r(k) &\triangleq \begin{bmatrix}
		{\bf u}_r(k) \\ {\bf u}_r(k+1) \\ \vdots \\ {\bf u}_r(k+N-1)
	\end{bmatrix}
\end{align*}


\section{Simulation results}
\label{sec:simulations}

In this section, simulation results are shown for the MPC applied to the WMR. The optimization problem has been solved with the {\sc Matlab} routine {\tt quadprog}. The initial configuration of the WMR and the reference car are, respectively, ${\bf x}(0)=[0~~-1~~\pi/2]^T$ and ${\bf x}_r(0)=[0~~0~~0]^T$. The weighting matrices used are ${\bf Q}=diag(1,1,0.5)$ and ${\bf R}=0.1{\bf I}_{2\times 2}$. The prediction horizon is $N=5$. Constraints in the amplitude of the control variables are: $v_{min}=-0.4 m/s$, $v_{max}=0.4 m/s$, $w_{min}=-0.4 rad/s$ and $w_{max}=0.4 rad/s$.

\begin{figure}[H]

    \includegraphics[width=.95\linewidth]{Figures/states.eps}
    \caption{States $x$, $y$ and $\theta$.}
    \label{fig:states}
\end{figure}

It can be clearly seen that the state asymptoticaly converges to the references. In Fig.~\ref{fig:traj8} and \ref{fig:states}, the dash-dotted line stands for the reference trajectory of the states. Fig.~\ref{fig:errors} shows the errors of the states converging to zero. It must be noted that, even without error in the $x$ state, the WMR must turn away from the reference trajectory to obey the nonholonomic constraint (\ref{eqn:nc}). In Fig.~\ref{fig:controls}, it can be seen that the control inputs are inside the limits imposed by the constraints. As the state and control errors converge to zero (Fig.~\ref{fig:errors}), one could say that the value of the cost function should converges to zero too. This fact can be observed in Fig.~\ref{fig:cost}.

    \includegraphics[width=.95\linewidth]{Figures/errors.eps}
    \caption{Errors.}
    \label{fig:errors}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
	\centering
    \includegraphics[width=.95\linewidth]{Figures/cost.eps}
    \caption{Cost function $\Phi(k)$.}
    \label{fig:cost}
\end{figure}

A typical measure of convergence is the integrated error~\cite{essen01},
\begin{equation*}
	\varepsilon \triangleq \frac{1}{K_f}\sum_{k=0}^{K_f}\left\|{\bf x}\right\|^2,
\end{equation*}
where $K_f$ is the number of steps to cover all the trajectory and $\left\|{\bf\cdot}\right\|$ is the euclidean norm.

Some results relating the computational cost and the error $\varepsilon$ with the prediction horizon $N$ are shown in Table \ref{table:table1}. $\tau$ denotes the mean time in seconds to solve the optimization problem for one step of the trajectory and FLOP's denotes the amount of floating point operations for one step of the trajectory.

\begin{table}[H]
	\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.5}
	\caption{Influence of $N$ in the computational cost and in $\varepsilon$}
	\label{table:table1}
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c}
		\hline
		$H$ & $\tau$ (sec.) & FLOP's & $\varepsilon$ \\
		\hline\hline
		1  & 0.0110 & 4343    & 3.2578  \\
		3  & 0.0114 & 9529    & 1.4384  \\
		5  & 0.0135 & 25643   & 1.3757  \\
		10 & 0.0271 & 160180  & 1.3695  \\
		15 & 0.0582 & 528570  & 1.3798  \\
		20 & 0.1156 & 1269500 & 1.3927  \\
		30 & 0.3402 & 4949000 & 1.4856  \\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Obviously the prediction horizon must be chosen in a way such that the time $\tau$ is smaller than the sampling period, $T$. In this case, $T=0.1$ seconds, so with $N=20$ the MPC is not feasible anymore. Also, the computational effort with respect to the amount of floating point operations should be used as a performance index. Analizing the FLOP's and $\varepsilon$, a well acceptable choice is $N=5$, considering that $\tau$ is about 10 times smaller than $T$ and the number of FLOP's is about 6 times smaller than the number of FLOP's for $N=10$. Notice also that for $N\geq10$ the error $\varepsilon$ can not be taken as a decisive factor anymore. The computations were carried out on a Athlon 2500+ with 512MB RAM running Linux.
