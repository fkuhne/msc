\begin{abstract}
This paper presents an optimal control scheme for trajectory tracking of a wheeled mobile robot (WMR) with nonholonomic constraints. It is well known that a WMR with nonholonomic constraints cannot be feedback stabilized to an equilibrium point through continuously differentiable, time-invariant control laws. Using model predictive control (MPC), a discontinuous control law is naturally obtained, being possible to consider constraints due to state or input limitations. By successive linearization of the kinematic model of the WMR, quadratic programming (QP) can be used to solve a linear MPC. Simulation results are shown.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
The field of mobile robot control has been the focus of great research effort in the past decades. Besides the apparent simplicity of the kinematic model of a wheeled mobile robot (WMR), the existence of nonholonomic (or non-integrable) constraints turns the design of stabilizing control laws for that systems a great challenge, and due to Brocket's conditions \cite{brockett82}, a continuously differentiable, time-invariant stabilizing feedback control law cannot be obtained. Most works in that sense uses discontinuous (non-smooth) and time-variant control laws (see \cite{bloch89,samson91,canudas92,yamamoto94,murray97} and the references therein). Recent works dealing with robust and adaptive control of WMR's can be found in \cite{oya03,dixon04}, for example.

However, in general, for realistic implementations it is difficult to obtain good performance, due to the constraints of input or state that naturally exist. None of the above cited authors have taken those constraints into account. This can be done in a straightforward way using model predictive control (MPC) schemes. For a WMR this is an important advantage, because the position of the robot can be restricted to belong to a secure region of operation (imagine a WMR crossing a corridor, for example). With input limitations, the control actions can be limited to prevent actuators' saturations.

MPC is a control strategy that uses the model of the system being controlled to obtain an optimal control sequence by minimizing an objective function. At each sample interval, the model provides a prediction of process states over a prediction horizon. Based on that, an objective function is optimized with respect to the future open-loop control inputs of the system. Although prediction and optimization are computed over a future horizon, only the values of the inputs for the current sample interval are used and the same procedure is repeated at the next sample instant. This mechanism is known as {\it moving} or {\it receding horizon} strategy, in reference to the way in which the time window considered in the calculations shifts forward from one time step to the next.

MPC was very well implemented in the process industries where plants being controlled are sufficiently {\em slow} to permit its implementation \cite{mayne98,allgower99}. One of the main reasons for such success is the ability of the MPC to handle constraints in a very flexible way \cite{garcia89}. However, for systems with fast and/or nonlinear dynamics, like the WMR's, the implementation of such technique is often a hard task, due to large amount of {\em on-line} computation required. In this paper we try to overcome this problem by using a successive-linearization approach, where a linear MPC is solved by quadratic programming (QP) problem. With some simulations results, it is shown that even a real-time implementation is possible. Works dealing with MPC of WMR's are recent and sparse \cite{ollero91,rico99,essen01}.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: in the next section the kinematic model of the WMR is shown. The MPC algorithm is depicted in Section \ref{sec:mpc}. Simulation results in {\sc matlab} are shown in Section \ref{sec:simulations}, where an eight-like trajectory is used as reference. The paper finishes with the conclusions. 

\section{Kinematic model of the WMR}\label{sec:model}
In this section the kinematic model of the WMR is described. A mobile robot made up of a rigid body and non deformable wheels is considered and depicted in Fig. \ref{fig:robot}. It is assumed that the vehicle moves without slipping in an horizontal ground. The kinematics of the WMR is given by:
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:model}
	\left\{
		\begin{aligned}
			\dot x	  &= v\cos\theta \\
			\dot y	  &= v\sin\theta \\
			\dot \theta &= w \\
		\end{aligned}
	\right.
\end{equation}

${\bf x}\triangleq[x~~y~~\theta]^T$ describes the configuration (position and orientation) of the center of mass $C$ of the robot with respect to a global inertial frame $\{O,X,Y\}$, and ${\bf u}\triangleq[v~~w]^T$ is the manipulated (control) variables, where $v$ and $w$ are the forward and angular velocities, respectively.
\begin{figure}[t]\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=.67\linewidth]{Figures/robot.eps}
    \caption{Kinematic model of the WMR.}
    \label{fig:robot}
\end{center}\end{figure}

An error model between (\ref{eqn:model}) and a reference model ${\bf x}_r\triangleq [x_r~~y_r~~\theta_r]^T$ can be described as follows:
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:errormodel}
	\left\{
		\begin{aligned}
			\dot e_x	    &= e_v\cos\theta_r \\
			\dot e_y	    &= e_v\sin\theta_r \\
			\dot e_\theta &= e_w \\
		\end{aligned}
	\right.
\end{equation}
with the following definitions:
\begin{equation*}\label{eqn:T}
	{\bf e}_{\bf x} \triangleq \begin{bmatrix}
		e_x \\ e_y \\ e_\theta
	\end{bmatrix} =
	\begin{bmatrix}
		\cos\theta_r  & \sin\theta_r & 0 \\
		-\sin\theta_r & \cos\theta_r & 0 \\
		0		    & 0		    & 1
	\end{bmatrix} 
	\begin{bmatrix}
		x-x_r \\ y-y_r \\ \theta-\theta_r
	\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}
and
\begin{equation*}\label{eqn:eu}
	{\bf e}_{\bf u} \triangleq {\bf u} - {\bf u}_r = \begin{bmatrix}
		e_v \\ e_w
	\end{bmatrix} =
	\begin{bmatrix}
		v-v_r \\ w-w_r
	\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}

Indeed, the convergence of ${\bf x}$ to ${\bf x}_r$ is equivalent to the convergence of ${\bf e_x}$ to the set ${\cal O}=\{{\bf x}|(e_x,e_y,e_\theta)=(0,0,2\pi n)\},n\in \{0,\pm1,\pm2,\ldots\}$.

Discretizing (\ref{eqn:errormodel}) by the Euler method, we have the following nonlinear, discrete-time error model:
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:discreteerror}
	\left\{
		\begin{aligned}
			e_x(k+1)	    &= e_x(k) + e_v(k)\cos\theta_r(k)T \\
			e_y(k+1)	    &= e_y(k) + e_v(k)\sin\theta_r(k)T \\
			e_\theta(k+1) &= e_\theta(k) + e_w(k)T \\
		\end{aligned}
	\right.,
\end{equation}
where $k$ is the sampling time and $T$ is the sampling period. It must be noted that actually there are only reference states. The reference controls ${\bf u}_r$ can be obtained, using ${\bf x}_r$, with:
\begin{align*}
	v_r(k) &= \frac{x_r(k+1)-x_r(k)}{\cos\theta_r(k) T}, \\
	w_r(k) &= \frac{\theta_r(k+1)-\theta_r(k)}{T}
\end{align*}

Now, it is possible to reformulate the error model as a linear, time-variant model. Considering (\ref{eqn:discreteerror}) equal to \mbox{${\bf x}(k+1)=f({\bf x}(k),{\bf u}(k))$}, we have:
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:error2}
	{\bf e}_{\bf x}(k+1) = {\bf A}(k){\bf e_x}(k) + {\bf B}(k){\bf e_u}(k),
\end{equation}
where




\begin{align*}
	{\bf A}(k) &\triangleq \left.\frac{\partial f}{\partial{\bf x}}\right|{\begin{matrix}{c} {\bf x}={\bf x}_r \\ {\bf u}={\bf u}_r \end{Sb}} = \begin{bmatrix}
		1 & 0 & -\sin\theta_r(k)v_r(k)T \\
		0 & 1 &  \cos\theta_r(k)v_r(k)T \\
		0 & 0 & 1
	\end{bmatrix}, \\
	{\bf B}(k) &\triangleq \frac{\partial f}{\partial{\bf x}} = \begin{bmatrix}
		\cos\theta_r(k)T & 0 \\
		\sin\theta_r(k)T & 0 \\
		0 			  & T
	\end{bmatrix}
\end{align*}

Equation (\ref{eqn:error2}) is a discrete-time, time-variant, linear error model for the WMR, and will be used in the MPC algorithm for the QP problem resolution.

Bloch and McClamroch \cite{bloch89} showed that the nonlinear, nonholonomic system of (\ref{eqn:model}) is fully controllable, i.e., it can be steered from any initial state to any final state in finite time by using finite inputs. It is easy to note that the linearization about a stationary operating point, when the car is motionless, is not controllable. However, this linearization becomes controllable as long as the control inputs ${\bf u}$ are existing \cite{samson91}. This implies that the tracking of a reference trajectory would be possible with linear MPC \cite{essen01}.

\section{The MPC Algorithm}\label{sec:mpc}
MPC has become a preferred control strategy for a large number of processes \cite{rawlings93}. One of the main reasons for this preference include the straightforward ability to handle constraints in an optimal way and the flexible formulation in the time domain \cite{allgower99,garcia89}. As cited in Section \ref{sec:intro}, the essence of this control scheme is to optimize, over the control inputs, predictions of process behavior. Such prediction is accomplished using a process model over a finite time interval, usually called the {\em prediction horizon}. At each sample time, the model predictive controller generates an optimal control sequence by solving a minimization problem. The first element of this sequence is applied to the plant being controlled. The problem is solved again at the next time interval using updated process measurements and a shifted horizon.

In this work, for simplicity we assume that the states of the plant are always available for measure, and that there are no plant/model mismatch.

Usually, the optimization problem can be written as:
\begin{equation}
	\min_{\bf\varphi}\left\{\Phi\right\}
\end{equation}
subject to:
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:constr}
	{\bf L{\bf\varphi}} \leq |{\bf d}|
\end{equation}

${\bf\varphi}$ is the free variable in the optimization, $\Phi$ is the so-called {\em cost function} and usually, for linear systems, takes a quadratic form, and ${\bf L}$ is a matrix relating the free variable with its limit ${\bf d}$.

The cost function to be minimized is the following\footnote{The notation $a(k+j|k)$ indicates the value of $a$ at the instant $k+j$ calculated at instant $k$.}:
\begin{multline}\label{eqn:cost}
	\Phi = \sum_{j=1}^{N}{\bf e}_{\bf x}^T(k+j|k){\bf Q}{\bf e}_{\bf x}(k+j|k) + \\ + {\bf e}_{\bf u}^T(k+j-1|k){\bf R}{\bf e}_{\bf u}(k+j-1|k),
\end{multline}
where $N$ is the prediction horizon and ${\bf Q}$, ${\bf R}$ are positive definite weighting matrices. The free variable, in this case, will be the control error ${\bf e_u}$.

\subsection{Derivation of the QP problem}\label{sec:qp}
In the following, the MPC optimization problem will be recast as a standard QP problem. Equation (\ref{eqn:cost}) can be rewritten as:
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:cost2}
	\Phi = \overline{\bf e}_{\bf x}^T\overline{\bf Q}\overline{\bf e}_{\bf x} + \overline{\bf e}_{\bf u}^T\overline{\bf R}\overline{\bf e}_{\bf u},
\end{equation}
with
\begin{align*}
	\overline {\bf e}_{\bf x} &\triangleq \begin{bmatrix}
		{\bf e}_{\bf x}(k+1|k) \\ {\bf e}_{\bf x}(k+2|k) \\ \vdots \\ {\bf e}_{\bf x}(k+N|k) 
	\end{bmatrix} \quad
	\overline{\bf e}_{\bf u} \triangleq \begin{bmatrix}
		{\bf e_u}(k|k)  \\ {\bf e_u}(k+1|k) \\ \vdots \\ {\bf e_u}(k+N-1)
	\end{bmatrix} \\
	\overline {\bf Q} &\triangleq \begin{bmatrix}
		{\bf Q} & {\bf 0} & \cdots & {\bf 0} \\
		{\bf 0} & {\bf Q} & \cdots & {\bf 0} \\
		\vdots  & \vdots  & \ddots & \vdots  \\
		{\bf 0} & {\bf 0} & \cdots & {\bf Q} \\
	\end{bmatrix} \qquad
	\overline {\bf R} \triangleq \begin{bmatrix}
		{\bf R} & {\bf 0} & \cdots & {\bf 0} \\
		{\bf 0} & {\bf R} & \cdots & {\bf 0} \\
		\vdots  & \vdots  & \ddots & \vdots  \\
		{\bf 0} & {\bf 0} & \cdots & {\bf R} \\
	\end{bmatrix}
\end{align*}

By means of the {\em Superposition Principle} for the time-variant linear model (\ref{eqn:error2}), the following expression can be derived:
\begin{multline*}
	{\bf e}_{\bf x}(k+j|k) = {\bf A}^j(k){\bf e}_{\bf x}(k|k) + \\ + \sum_{i=0}^{j-1}{\bf A}^{j-1-i}(k+i){\bf B}(k+i){\bf e}_{\bf u}(k+i|k)
\end{multline*}
and the state error $\overline{\bf e}_{\bf x}$ takes the form:
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:exbar}
	\overline{\bf e}_{\bf x}=\overline{\bf A}{\bf e}_{\bf x}(k|k)+{\bf S}\overline{\bf e}_{\bf u},
\end{equation}
where $\overline{\bf A} \triangleq [{\bf A}(k)~~{\bf A}^2(k)~~\cdots~~{\bf A}^N(k)]^T$ and
{\small
\begin{equation*}
	{\bf S} \triangleq \begin{bmatrix}
		{\bf B}(k)                 & {\bf 0} 					& \cdots & {\bf 0}       \\
		{\bf A}(k){\bf B}(k)       & {\bf B}(k+1)      			& \cdots & {\bf 0}       \\
		\vdots	                 & \vdots		     		& \ddots & \vdots        \\
		{\bf A}^{N-1}(k){\bf B}(k) & {\bf A}^{N-2}(k+1){\bf B}(k+1) & \cdots & {\bf B}(k+N-1)
	\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}}

With (\ref{eqn:cost2}) and (\ref{eqn:exbar}) at hands, and after some algebraic manipulations, we can rewrite the cost function in a standard quadratic form:
\begin{equation}
	\Phi = \frac{1}{2}\overline{\bf e}_{\bf u}^T{\bf H}\overline{\bf e}_{\bf u} + {\bf f}^T\overline{\bf e}_{\bf u}
\end{equation}
with
\begin{align*}
	{\bf H} &= 2\left({\bf S}^T\overline{\bf Q}{\bf S}+\overline{\bf R}\right) \\
	{\bf f} &= 2{\bf S}^T\overline{\bf Q}\overline{\bf A}{\bf e}_{\bf x}(k|k)
\end{align*}

The matrix ${\bf H}$ is the {\em Hessian} matrix, and must be positive definite. It describes the quadratic part of the cost function, and the vector ${\bf f}$ describes the linear part. In this case, the free variable in the optimization is the vector $\overline{\bf e}_{\bf u}$, and the constraint (\ref{eqn:constr}) must be rewritten with respect to this variable:
\begin{equation*}
	\overline{\bf L}_{\bf u}\overline{\bf e}_{\bf u} \leq |\overline{\bf d}_{\bf u}| - \overline{\bf L}_{\bf u}\overline{\bf u}_r
\end{equation*}
to constrain the control ${\bf u}$, with:
\begin{equation*}
	\overline{\bf L} \triangleq \begin{bmatrix}
		{\bf L} & {\bf 0} & \cdots & {\bf 0} \\
		{\bf 0} & {\bf L} & \cdots & {\bf 0} \\
		\vdots  & \vdots  & \ddots & \vdots  \\
		{\bf 0} & {\bf 0} & \cdots & {\bf L}
	\end{bmatrix}, ~
	\overline{\bf d} \triangleq \begin{bmatrix}
		{\bf d} \\ {\bf d} \\ \vdots \\ {\bf d}
	\end{bmatrix}, ~
	\overline{\bf u}_r \triangleq \begin{bmatrix}
		{\bf u}_r(k|k) \\ {\bf u}_r(k+1|k) \\ \vdots \\ {\bf u}_r(k+N-1|k)
	\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}

\section{Simulation results}\label{sec:simulations}
In this section, simulation results are shown for the MPC applied to a WMR. The computations are made with the {\sc matlab} routine {\tt quadprog}. The data used for the simulation are: ${\bf x}(0)=[-0.3~~1.2~~\pi/2]^T$ (initial configuration of the WMR), ${\bf Q}={\bf I}_{3\times 3}$, ${\bf R}={\bf I}_{2\times 2}$ and $N=3$. It can be seen that the state converges to the references. In Fig. \ref{fig:traj8} and \ref{fig:states}, the dash-dotted line stands for the reference trajectory of the states. Fig. \ref{fig:errors} shows the errors of the states converging to zero.

\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusions}
This paper has presented the application of MPC to a nonholonomic WMR, represented by means of a kinematic model. It was shown the solution of the optimization problem through a simple QP method. The computations were made using {\sc matlab}. Such research will obviously continue, and the authors' main objective is real-time simulations of nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) applied to WMR's.
