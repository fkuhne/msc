\begin{abstract}
This paper presents an optimal control scheme for a wheeled mobile robot (WMR) with nonholonomic constraints. It is well known that a WMR with nonholonomic constraints can not be feedback stabilized through continuously differentiable, time-invariant control laws. By using model predictive control (MPC), a discontinuous control law is naturally obtained. One of the main advantages of MPC is the ability to handle constraints (due to state or input limitations) in a straightforward way. Quadratic programming (QP) is used to solve a linear MPC by successive linearization of an error model of the WMR. Simulation and experimental results are shown.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

The field of mobile robot control has been the focus of great research effort in the past decades. Besides the apparent simplicity of the kinematic model of a wheeled mobile robot (WMR), the existence of nonholonomic (non-integrable) constraints turns the design of stabilizing control laws for those systems in a considerable challenge. Due to Brockett
conditions~\cite{brockett82}, a continuously differentiable, time-invariant stabilizing feedback control law can not be obtained. To overcome these limitations most works uses discontinuous (non-smooth) and time-variant control laws~\cite{bloch89,samson91,canudas92,yamamoto94,murray97}. Recent works dealing with robust and adaptive control of WMRs can be found in \cite{oya03,dixon04}.

However, in realistic implementations it is difficult to obtain good performance, due to the constraints on inputs or states that naturally arise. None of the previously cited authors have taken those constraints into account. This can be done in a straightforward way by using model predictive control (MPC) schemes. For a WMR this is an important advantage,
since the position of the robot can be restricted to belong to a secure region of operation. By considering input limitations, control actions that stay within actuators saturation limit can be generated.

Model Predictive Control is a control strategy that uses the model of the system to obtain an optimal control sequence by minimizing an objective function. At each sample interval, the model provides a prediction of process states over a prediction horizon. Based on that, an objective function is optimized with respect to the future open-loop control system
inputs. Although prediction and optimization are computed over a future horizon, only the values of the inputs for the current sampling interval are used and the same procedure is repeated at the next sampling time. This mechanism is known as {\it moving} or {\it receding horizon} strategy, in reference to the way in which the time window shifts forward from one time step to the next.

For complex constrained multivariable control problems, MPC has become the
accepted standard in the process industries~\cite{bemporad02}. It is used in
many cases, where plants being controlled are
sufficiently {\em slow} to permit its implementation~\cite{mayne98}.
However, for systems with fast and/or nonlinear dynamics, like the WMRs,
the implementation of such technique remains fundamentally limited in
applicability, due to large amount of {\em on-line} computation required
\cite{cannon00}. In this paper we overcome this problem by using a
successive-linearization approach, where a linear MPC is solved by quadratic
programming (QP) problem. It is shown that
even a real-time implementation is possible. Although MPC is not a new
control method, works dealing with MPC of WMRs are recent and sparse
\cite{ollero91,rico99,essen01}.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: in the next section the
kinematic model of the WMR is shown. The MPC algorithm is depicted in
section~\ref{sec:mpc}. Simulation results in {\sc Matlab} are shown in
section~\ref{sec:simulations}, where an eight-like trajectory is used as
reference. Section~\ref{sec:exp} presents real-time implementation remarks.


\section{Kinematic Model of the WMR}
\label{sec:model}

In this section the kinematic model of the WMR is described. A mobile robot
made up of a rigid body and non deforming wheels is considered and depicted
in Figure~\ref{fig:robot}. It is assumed that the vehicle moves without
slipping on an horizontal plane. The kinematics of the WMR is given by:

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:model}
	\left\{
		\begin{aligned}
			\dot x	  &= v\cos\theta \\
			\dot y	  &= v\sin\theta \\
			\dot \theta &= w
		\end{aligned}
	\right.
\end{equation}

\noindent where ${\bf x}\triangleq[x~~y~~\theta]^T$ describes the
configuration (position and orientation) of the center of mass $C$ with
respect to a global inertial frame $\{O,X,Y\}$. ${\bf u}\triangleq[v~~w]^T$
are the manipulated (control) variables, where $v$ and $w$ are the forward
and the angular velocity, respectively.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.67\linewidth]{Figures/robot.eps}
    \caption{Kinematic model of the WMR.}
    \label{fig:robot}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

By using the Euler method to discretize (\ref{eqn:model}):

\begin{equation*}
	\dot{\bf x} \approx \frac{{\bf x}(k+1)-{\bf x}(k)}{T},
\end{equation*}

\noindent where $T$ is the sampling period and $k$ is the time step, we have
the following nonlinear, discrete-time model:

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:discretemodel}
	\left\{
		\begin{aligned}
			x(k+1)	    &= x(k) + v(k)\cos\theta_r(k)T \\
			y(k+1)	    &= y(k) + v(k)\sin\theta_r(k)T \\
			\theta(k+1) &= \theta(k) + w(k)T \\
		\end{aligned}
	\right.
\end{equation} 

\subsection{Derivation of a Linear Error Model}

The kinematic model can be redefined as an error model with respect to a
reference trajectory $({\bf x}_r,{\bf u}_r)$. This can be done by expanding
the kinematic model in Taylor series around the reference trajectory. The
resulting error model is a linear, time-variant error model that will be
used in Section \ref{sec:mpc} for the solution of a linear MPC problem.

The model (\ref{eqn:discretemodel}) has the form ${\bf x}(k+1)=f({\bf
x}(k),{\bf u}(k))$. Expanding in Taylor series around the point $({\bf
x}_r(k),{\bf u}_r(k))$ and neglecting higher order
terms the following expression is obtained:

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\label{eq:taylor}
	f({\bf x}(k),{\bf u}(k)) &\approx f({\bf x}_r(k),{\bf u}_r(k)) + \\ &+ \left.\frac{\partial f}{\partial{\bf x}(k)}\right|_{\begin{smallmatrix}{\bf x}(k)={\bf x}_r(k) \\ {\bf u}(k)={\bf u}_r(k) \end{smallmatrix}}({\bf x}(k)-{\bf x}_r(k)) + \\ &+ \left.\frac{\partial f}{\partial{\bf u}(k)}\right|_{\begin{smallmatrix}{\bf x}(k)={\bf x}_r(k) \\ {\bf u}(k)={\bf u}_r(k) \end{smallmatrix}}({\bf u}(k)-{\bf u}_r(k))
\end{split}
\end{equation}

Notice that ${\bf x}_r(k+1)=f({\bf x}_r(k),{\bf u}_r(k))$. Therefore
(\ref{eq:taylor}) can be rewritten as:

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:error}
	\tilde{\bf x}(k+1) = {\bf A}(k)\tilde{\bf x}(k)+{\bf B}(k)\tilde{\bf u}(k),
\end{equation}
\noindent where
\begin{equation*}
	\tilde{\bf x}(k) \triangleq \begin{bmatrix}
		\cos\theta_r(k)  & \sin\theta_r(k) & 0 \\
		-\sin\theta_r(k) & \cos\theta_r(k) & 0 \\
		0		       & 0		     & 1
	\end{bmatrix} 
	\begin{bmatrix}
		x(k)-x_r(k) \\ y(k)-y_r(k) \\ \theta(k)-\theta_r(k)
	\end{bmatrix},
\end{equation*}
$$
\tilde{\bf u}(k)\triangleq{\bf u}(k)-{\bf u}_r(k)
$$
\noindent and
\begin{align*}
	{\bf A}(k) &= \begin{bmatrix}
		1 & 0 & -v_r(k)\sin\theta_r(k)T \\
		0 & 1 &  v_r(k)\cos\theta_r(k)T \\
		0 & 0 & 1
	\end{bmatrix} \\
	{\bf B}(k) &= \begin{bmatrix}
		\cos\theta_r(k)T & 0 \\
		\sin\theta_r(k)T & 0 \\
		0 			  & T
	\end{bmatrix}
\end{align*}

Indeed, the convergence of ${\bf x}$ to ${\bf x}_r$ is equivalent to the
convergence of $\tilde{\bf x}$ to the set ${\cal O}=\{{\bf x}|(\tilde
x,\tilde y,\tilde\theta)=(0,0,2\pi n)\},n\in \{0,\pm1,\pm2,\ldots\}$.

In~\cite{bloch89} it is shown that the nonlinear, nonholonomic system
(\ref{eqn:model}) is fully controllable, i.e., it can be steered from any
initial state to any final state in finite time by using finite inputs. It
is easy to see that when the robot is not moving, the linearization about a
stationary operating point is not controllable. However, this linearization
becomes controllable as long as the control inputs ${\bf u}$ are not
zero~\cite{samson91}. This implies that the tracking of a reference
trajectory is possible with linear MPC~\cite{essen01}.

\section{The MPC Algorithm}
\label{sec:mpc}

It was said in section~\ref{sec:intro} that the essence of a MPC scheme is
to optimize, over the control inputs, predictions of process behavior. Such
prediction is accomplished by using a process model over a finite time
interval, called the {\em prediction horizon}. At each sampling time, the
model predictive controller generates an optimal control sequence by solving
a minimization problem. The first element of this sequence is applied to the
plant. The problem is solved again at the next sampling time using the
updated process measurements and a shifted horizon.

For the sake of simplicity, we assume in this work that the states of the
plant are always available for measurement and that there are no
plant/model mismatch. Also, in order to design the linear controller, it is
assumed that the pair $({\bf A}(k),{\bf B}(k))$ is always (at any $k$)
stabilizable.

Usually, the optimization problem can be stated as to find $\varphi^\star$
such that:
\begin{equation*}
	\varphi^\star = \arg\min_{\bf\varphi}\left\{\Phi(k)\right\}
\end{equation*}
\noindent s. a.
\begin{equation*}\label{eqn:constr}
	{\bf\varphi}_{min} \leq {\bf\varphi} \leq {\bf\varphi}_{max}
\end{equation*}

\noindent where $\Phi(k)$ is the {\em cost function}, ${\bf\varphi}$ is the
free variable in the optimization, and ${\bf\varphi}_{min}$ and
${\bf\varphi}_{max}$ are its inferior and superior limits, respectively.

To the problem concerned here, the cost function to be minimized can be stated as a quadratic function os the states and control inputs:
\begin{multline}\label{eqn:cost}
	\Phi(k) = \sum_{j=1}^{N}\tilde{\bf x}^T(k+j|k){\bf Q}\tilde{\bf x}(k+j|k) + \\ + \tilde{\bf u}^T(k+j-1|k){\bf R}\tilde{\bf u}(k+j-1|k),
\end{multline}
\noindent where $N$ is the prediction horizon and ${\bf Q}$, ${\bf R}$ are
weighting matrices, with ${\bf Q}\geq 0$ and ${\bf R}>0$. The free variable
is the control error $\tilde{\bf u}$. The notation $a(k+j|k)$
indicates the value of $a$ at the instant $k+j$ predicted at instant $k$.

The problem of minimizing (\ref{eqn:cost}) is solved at each time step $k$, yelding a sequence of minimizers ${\bar{\tilde{\bf u}}}\triangleq\{\tilde{\bf u}^\star(k|k),\cdots,\tilde{\bf u}^\star(k+N-1|k)\}$ and the optimal cost $\Phi^\star(k)$. The MPC control law is implictly given by the first control action of the sequence $\bar{\tilde{\bf u}}^\star$, $\tilde{\bf u}^\star(k|k)$.


\subsection{Derivation of the Quadratic Programming Problem}
\label{sec:qp}

To put the optimization problem in a form suitable for a QP formulation, we introduce stacked vectors (represented by a {\em overline}, $\bar{(\cdot)}$) with future states and control inputs
\begin{equation*}
	\bar{\tilde{\bf x}} \triangleq \begin{bmatrix}
		\tilde{\bf x}(k+1|k) \\ \tilde{\bf x}(k+2|k) \\ \vdots \\ \tilde{\bf x}(k+N|k) 
	\end{bmatrix} \quad
	\bar{\tilde{\bf u}} \triangleq \begin{bmatrix}
		\tilde{\bf u}(k|k)  \\ \tilde{\bf u}(k+1|k) \\ \vdots \\ \tilde{\bf u}(k+N-1|k)
	\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}

Thus, equation (\ref{eqn:cost}) can be rewritten as:
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:cost2}
	\Phi(k) = {\bar{\tilde{\bf x}}}^T\bar{\bf Q}{\bar{\tilde{\bf x}}} + {\bar{\tilde{\bf u}}}^T\bar{\bf R}{\bar{\tilde{\bf u}}},
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation*}
	\bar {\bf Q} \triangleq \begin{bmatrix}
		{\bf Q} & {\bf 0} & \cdots & {\bf 0} \\
		{\bf 0} & {\bf Q} & \cdots & {\bf 0} \\
		\vdots  & \vdots  & \ddots & \vdots  \\
		{\bf 0} & {\bf 0} & \cdots & {\bf Q}
	\end{bmatrix} \quad
	\bar {\bf R} \triangleq \begin{bmatrix}
		{\bf R} & {\bf 0} & \cdots & {\bf 0} \\
		{\bf 0} & {\bf R} & \cdots & {\bf 0} \\
		\vdots  & \vdots  & \ddots & \vdots  \\
		{\bf 0} & {\bf 0} & \cdots & {\bf R}
	\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}

With the above definitions, and by recursively applying $\tilde{\bf x}(k+i+1)={\bf A}(k+i)\tilde{\bf x}(k+i)+{\bf B}(k+i)\tilde{\bf u}(k+i)$, for $i=0$ to $N-1$, it is possible to rewrite $\bar{\tilde{\bf x}}$ as:
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:exbar}
	{\bar{\tilde{\bf x}}} = \bar{\bf A}\tilde{\bf x}(k|k)+{\bf S}{\bar{\tilde{\bf u}}},
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation*}
	\bar{\bf A} \triangleq \begin{bmatrix}
		{\bf A}(k|k) \\ {\bf A}(k|k){\bf A}(k+1|k) \\ \vdots \\ {\cal A}(0)
	\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}
{\small
\begin{multline*}
		{\bf S} \triangleq \\ \begin{bmatrix}
			{\bf B}(k|k)		      & {\bf 0} 			    & \cdots & {\bf 0}         \\
			{\bf A}(k+1|k){\bf B}(k|k)& {\bf B}(k+1|k)      	    & \cdots & {\bf 0}         \\
			\vdots			      & \vdots		              & \ddots & \vdots          \\
			{\cal A}(1){\bf B}(k|k)   & {\cal A}(2){\bf B}(k+1|k) & \cdots & {\bf B}(k+N-1|k)
		\end{bmatrix}
\end{multline*}
}
where 
\begin{equation*}
	{\cal A}(j) \triangleq \prod_{i=j}^{N-1}{\bf A}(k+i|k),
\end{equation*}

With (\ref{eqn:cost2}) and (\ref{eqn:exbar}) at hands, and after some algebraic manipulations, we can rewrite the cost function (\ref{eqn:cost}) in a standard quadratic form:
\begin{equation}
	\Phi(k) = \frac{1}{2}{\bar{\tilde{\bf u}}}^T{\bf H}{\bar{\tilde{\bf u}}} + {\bf f}^T{\bar{\tilde{\bf u}}} + {\bf d}
\end{equation}
with
\begin{align*}
	{\bf H} &\triangleq 2\left({\bf S}^T\bar{\bf Q}{\bf S}+\bar{\bf R}\right) \\
	{\bf f} &\triangleq 2{\bf S}^T\bar{\bf Q}\bar{\bf A}\tilde{\bf x}(k|k) \\
	{\bf d} &\triangleq \tilde{\bf x}^T(k|k)\bar{\bf A}^T\bar{\bf Q}\bar{\bf A}\tilde{\bf x}(k|k)
\end{align*}

The matrix ${\bf H}$ is the {\em Hessian} matrix, and must be positive definite. It describes the quadratic part of the cost function, and the vector ${\bf f}$ describes the linear part. $\bf d$ is independent of $\tilde{\bf u}$ and because of that vanishes of the optimization problem.

Now it is possible to define constraints, for example, in the amplitude of
the control action ${\bf u}(k)$ or, in the stacked form, $\bar {\bf
u}\triangleq[{\bf u}^T(k|k)~~\cdots~~{\bf u}^T(k+N-1|k)]^T$. So, we have the
following constraint:

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:uconstr}
	\bar{\bf u}_{min} \leq \bar{\bf u} \leq \bar{\bf u}_{max},
\end{equation}
with the limits 
\begin{equation*}
	{\bf u}_{min}(k) = \begin{bmatrix}
		v_{min}(k) \\ w_{min}(k)
	\end{bmatrix} \quad 
	{\bf u}_{max}(k) = \begin{bmatrix}
		v_{max}(k) \\ w_{max}(k)
	\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}
\noindent and
\begin{align*}
	\bar{\bf u}_{min} &\triangleq \begin{bmatrix}
		{\bf u}_{min}(k) \\ {\bf u}_{min}(k+1) \\ \vdots \\ {\bf u}_{min}(k+N-1)
	\end{bmatrix} \\
	\bar{\bf u}_{max} &\triangleq \begin{bmatrix}
		{\bf u}_{max}(k) \\ {\bf u}_{max}(k+1) \\ \vdots \\ {\bf u}_{max}(k+N-1)
	\end{bmatrix}
\end{align*}

In this case, the free variable in the optimization is the vector
$\bar{\tilde{\bf u}}$, and the constraint (\ref{eqn:uconstr}) must be
rewritten with respect to this variable (remembering that $\tilde{\bf
u}(k)={\bf u}(k)-{\bf u}_r(k)$):

\begin{equation*}
	\bar{\bf u}_{min} - \bar{\bf u}_r \leq {\bar{\tilde{\bf u}}} \leq \bar{\bf u}_{max} - \bar{\bf u}_r
\end{equation*}
where
\begin{equation*}
	\bar{\bf u}_r \triangleq \begin{bmatrix}
		{\bf u}_r(k) \\ {\bf u}_r(k+1) \\ \vdots \\ {\bf u}_r(k+N-1)
	\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}


\section{Simulation results}
\label{sec:simulations}

In this section, simulation results are shown for the MPC applied to the
WMR. The optimization problem has been solved with the {\sc Matlab} routine
{\tt quadprog}. The data used for the simulation were: ${\bf
x}(0)=[-0.8~~1~~3\pi/2]^T$ (initial configuration of the WMR), ${\bf Q}=diag(1,1,0.5)$, ${\bf R}=0.5{\bf I}_{2\times 2}$ and $N=3$. Constraints in
the amplitude of the control variables were imposed: $v_{min}=0.2 m/s$,
$v_{max}=0.4 m/s$, $w_{min}=-0.4 rad/s$ and $w_{max}=0.4 rad/s$. It can be
seen that the state converges to the references. In Fig. \ref{fig:traj8} and
\ref{fig:states}, the dash-dotted line stands for the reference trajectory
of the states.

    \caption{Trajectory covered by the WMR, in the $XY$ plane.}
    \label{fig:traj8}
\end{center}\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:errors} shows the errors of the states converging to zero. The
most interesting one is Fig.~\ref{fig:controls}. It can be clearly seen that
the control inputs obey the limits imposed by the constraints. As the state
errors converge to zero (Fig. \ref{fig:errors}), one could say that the
value of the cost function must converges to zero too. This fact can be
observed in Fig.~\ref{fig:cost}.
